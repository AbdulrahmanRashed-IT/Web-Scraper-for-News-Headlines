This Python script scrapes news headlines from a public website using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. It sends an HTTP GET request to fetch the page content, extracts the text from `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags, and saves the collected headlines in a file named headlines.txt. The project demonstrates basic web scraping, HTML parsing, and file handling in Python.
